                <p>This is a dynamic and interactive platform designed to raise awareness and foster action for the conservation of marine life and aquatic ecosystems. Covering over 70% of the Earthâ€™s surface, oceans play a critical role in regulating climate, providing food, and sustaining biodiversity, yet they face severe threats from overfishing, plastic pollution, oil spills, and climate change. This project is motivated by the urgent need to protect these vital ecosystems for current and future generations, offering educational resources, research insights, and practical guides to engage a diverse audience. Beneficiaries include students and researchers seeking knowledge, local communities and fishers adopting sustainable practices, environmental organizations and policymakers leveraging data for advocacy, and the general public adopting ocean-friendly habits, ultimately contributing to marine life preservation. By increasing public awareness, inspiring behavioral changes, empowering communities, supporting policy development, and protecting biodiversity, this website aims to drive significant impact toward healthier oceans and sustainable fisheries.</p>
